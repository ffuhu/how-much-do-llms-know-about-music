        "question": "Task Introduction: Hello! I need your expertise for a specific task. You are an expert in Optical Music Recognition (OMR) within the field of Computer Vision. The task involves analyzing an image which might or might not contain music notation within it. The music notation present might be monophonic, polyphonic or vocal. If present, it will be a music excerpt. Please answer any question I ask you based only on that excerpt. You can only provide information based on what is on the image, no matter how much you might know about it from other sources.Task Details: In the monophonic case, the music excerpt consists of only the musical staff with a single melodic line, without any lyrics, performance directions, or other textual elements. In the polyphonic case, there will be more than one melodic line. In the vocal case, you might also find the lyrics of the song. Your task is to analyze the musical notation, when present, and use the melody's structure, rhythm, and characteristics to answer some questions about the piece. If you are uncertain about an answer, you should clearly indicate so and explain why.Looking at the visual information on the image, can you find any kind of music representation in it?",
        "response": "Yes, I can see music representation in the image. I observe lines arranged vertically, which appear to be musical staff lines. There are also symbols and figures drawn on these lines, which suggest musical notation. \n\nBased on the visual information, it appears to be a musical excerpt. \n\nDo you want me to describe any specific features of the notation I'm seeing (e.g., the number of staff lines, the presence of clefs, specific symbols)?"

        "question": "Task Introduction: Hello! I need your expertise for a specific task. You are an expert in Optical Music Recognition (OMR) within the field of Computer Vision. The task involves analyzing an image which might or might not contain music notation within it. The music notation present might be monophonic, polyphonic or vocal. If present, it will be a music excerpt. Please answer any question I ask you based only on that excerpt. You can only provide information based on what is on the image, no matter how much you might know about it from other sources.Task Details: In the monophonic case, the music excerpt consists of only the musical staff with a single melodic line, without any lyrics, performance directions, or other textual elements. In the polyphonic case, there will be more than one melodic line. In the vocal case, you might also find the lyrics of the song. Your task is to analyze the musical notation, when present, and use the melody's structure, rhythm, and characteristics to answer some questions about the piece. If you are uncertain about an answer, you should clearly indicate so and explain why.Looking at the visual information on the image, can you find any kind of music representation in it?",
        "response": "Yes, I can see music notation in the image. It appears to be a musical score with a staff and notes. I can identify the presence of lines representing musical lines and symbols representing musical notes. \n\nHowever, without further analysis, I can’t determine if it's monophonic, polyphonic, or vocal. I need more details about the arrangement of the lines and symbols to differentiate between the three types."

        "response": "Yes, I can see music representation in the image. It appears to be a musical score, containing a staff with multiple lines. These lines contain symbols representing notes, rests, and other musical elements. The image clearly displays a musical structure."

        "response": "Yes, I can see music representation in the image. I observe what appears to be musical notation on a staff. It looks like a musical score with lines and spaces, suggesting a musical piece is represented. \n\nI cannot discern whether it's monophonic, polyphonic, or vocal based *solely* on this visual information. I need more details from the image to determine the complexity of the notation (e.g., are there multiple lines stacked on top of each other?)."
