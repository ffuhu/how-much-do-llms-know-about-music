The music appears to be organized in groups of notes connected by slurs, creating a consistent pattern that's characteristic of Bach's preludes.\n\nThe piece is written in C major initially, though there are some accidentals (sharps and flats) that appear in later measures, suggesting possible brief modulations or harmonic changes. Each system is numbered (3, 6, 9, 12, 15) at the beginning of the line to help the performer keep track of their place in the music."
